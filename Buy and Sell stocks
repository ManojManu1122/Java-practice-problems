You are given an array prices where prices[il is the price of a given stock
on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to
buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you
cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

public class Stock {
    public static int buyStocks(int prices[]) {
        int buyPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (buyPrice < prices[i]) {
                int profit = prices[i] - buyPrice;
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
            } else
                buyPrice = prices[i];
        }
        if (maxProfit > 0)
            return maxProfit;
        return 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int prices[] = { 7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4 };
        System.out.println("The maximum profit is: " + buyStocks(prices));
